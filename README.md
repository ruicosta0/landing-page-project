## *Description*

This is the repo for the Udactiy *Landing Page* project as part of the Front End Web Dev course. 

The project uses javascript to navigate and format a website landing page.

The repo contains the html, css, images and javascript files used to construct the landing page.

## *Instructions*

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
